# Basic example of using typedefs with ReasonML

Aims:

- Have relatively elaborate example `.typedefs` file ([Statebox protocol messages](https://github.com/typedefs/typedefs/issues/80))
- Installation of JS-Typedefs from NPM ([issue #1](https://github.com/typedefs/typedefs-example-reasonml/issues/1))
- Uses Typedefs Codegen to generate ReasonML code (so no dynamic/reflection support yet)
- Demonstrate specialization such as `(* nibble nibble)` ~> `Char`, etc
